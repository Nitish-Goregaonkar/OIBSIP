## 1. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

### How They Work
A DoS attack overwhelms a system, service, or network with excessive traffic, rendering it unable to respond to legitimate requests. DDoS attacks are an extension of DoS, utilizing multiple compromised computers (often forming a botnet) to launch large-scale attacks simultaneously from different sources.

### Impact
- Network congestion or total shutdown of services.
- Significant financial losses due to downtime.
- Damaged reputation and customer trust.
- Increased operational costs for mitigation and recovery.

### **Real-World Use Case:**
**GitHub Attack (2018):** GitHub, a major software development platform, was targeted with a DDoS attack that peaked at 1.35 Tbps. The attack was amplified using unsecured Memcached servers. GitHub's mitigation services automatically rerouted traffic to absorb the attack within 10 minutes.

### Prevention Measures
- Use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to balance traffic.
- Rate limiting and throttling requests.
- Deploying intrusion prevention and detection systems.
- Partnering with specialized DDoS protection providers like Cloudflare or Akamai.

## 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

### How They Work
MITM attacks occur when a malicious actor intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. This can happen on unencrypted or poorly secured networks, allowing attackers to eavesdrop, steal credentials, or inject malicious content.

### Impact
- Theft of sensitive data such as login credentials and personal information.
- Compromised integrity of communication.
- Financial fraud or identity theft.
- Breaches in compliance and data protection laws.

### **Real-World Use Case:**
**Lenovo Superfish Scandal (2015):** Lenovo pre-installed adware called "Superfish" on its laptops that intercepted HTTPS traffic using a self-signed root certificate. This allowed attackers to perform MITM attacks and compromise encrypted connections.

### Prevention Measures
- Enforce the use of HTTPS and TLS encryption.
- Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi or use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
- Implement HSTS headers and certificate pinning.
- Use strong mutual authentication protocols.

## 3. Spoofing (IP, MAC, and Email Spoofing)

### How They Work
Spoofing involves forging information to make it appear as if it originates from a trusted source. IP spoofing alters the source address in IP packets. MAC spoofing involves cloning a device's MAC address. Email spoofing is used to send messages from forged addresses to trick recipients.

### Impact
- Bypass of security filters.
- Unauthorized access to secure systems.
- Support for broader attacks such as phishing or MITM.
- Disruption of network communication.

### **Real-World Use Case:**
**Smurf Attack:** This classic DDoS technique uses IP spoofing to send ICMP requests to broadcast addresses with the victim's IP, resulting in a flood of responses that overwhelm the victim.

### Prevention Measures
- Enable source validation and packet filtering on routers.
- Use authentication mechanisms that donâ€™t rely solely on IP/MAC.
- Configure intrusion detection systems to detect anomalies.
- Employ domain authentication protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for emails.

## 4. Phishing

### How It Works
Phishing attacks trick users into revealing sensitive data by imitating trustworthy entities through emails, websites, or messages. They often include malicious links or attachments.

### Impact
- Credential theft and unauthorized access.
- Financial losses due to fraudulent transactions.
- Large-scale data breaches.
- Damage to organizational trust.

### **Real-World Use Case:**
**Google and Facebook Fraud (2013-2015):** Attackers impersonated a hardware supplier and tricked both companies into paying over $100 million in fake invoices. The scam relied on authentic-looking emails and domain spoofing.

### Prevention Measures
- Conduct security awareness training.
- Use anti-phishing software and spam filters.
- Enforce two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Regularly perform simulated phishing exercises.

## 5. Malware (Viruses, Worms, Trojans, Ransomware)

### How It Works
Malware refers to software designed to harm, exploit, or steal from systems. It can arrive through downloads, infected USB drives, email attachments, or vulnerabilities in outdated software.

### Impact
- Data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access.
- System and network downtime.
- High costs for data recovery and system repair.
- Legal and compliance repercussions.

### **Real-World Use Case:**
**WannaCry Ransomware Attack (2017):** Exploiting a Windows vulnerability, this attack encrypted data on over 200,000 computers in 150 countries, affecting hospitals, banks, and businesses. Victims were asked to pay in Bitcoin to regain access.

### Prevention Measures
- Regularly update and patch operating systems.
- Use endpoint protection software.
- Conduct regular security audits.
- Isolate infected systems immediately.

## 6. SQL Injection (SQLi)

### How It Works
SQL Injection exploits improperly sanitized input fields to execute arbitrary SQL queries on a database. Attackers can retrieve, modify, or delete sensitive data.

### Impact
- Unauthorized access to databases.
- Theft of confidential records.
- Damage to application functionality.
- Potential for complete system takeover.

### **Real-World Use Case:**
**Heartland Payment Systems Breach (2008):** Hackers exploited SQL injection to install spyware on servers processing credit card data, compromising over 100 million records.

### Prevention Measures
- Use parameterized queries and ORM frameworks.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).
- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments.

## 7. Brute Force and Credential Stuffing

### How They Work
Brute force attacks attempt to guess passwords by trying many combinations. Credential stuffing uses previously leaked credentials across multiple sites, banking on users reusing passwords.

### Impact
- Unauthorized account access.
- Lockout of legitimate users.
- Theft of sensitive or financial data.
- Damage to brand reputation.

### **Real-World Use Case:**
**Zoom Credential Stuffing (2020):** Thousands of Zoom account credentials were found on the dark web due to reused passwords from other breaches.

### Prevention Measures
- Enforce strong, unique passwords.
- Use CAPTCHA and account lockout mechanisms.
- Implement 2FA or MFA.
- Monitor login patterns for anomalies.
